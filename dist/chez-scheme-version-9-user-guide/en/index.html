<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em> is both a general-purpose programming language and an implementation of that language, with supporting tools and documentation. As a superset of the language described in the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on Scheme (R6RS), <em>Chez Scheme</em> supports all standard features of Scheme, including first-class procedures, proper treatment of tail calls, continuations, user-defined records, libraries, exceptions, and hygienic macro expansion. <em>Chez Scheme</em> supports numerous non-R6RS features. A few of these are local and top-level modules, local import, foreign datatypes and procedures, nonblocking I/O, an interactive top-level, compile-time values and properties, pretty-printing, and formatted output.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation includes a compiler that generates native code for each processor upon which it runs along with a run-time system that provides automatic storage management, foreign-language interfaces, source-level debugging, profiling support, and an extensive run-time library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The threaded versions of <em>Chez Scheme</em> support native threads, allowing Scheme programs to take advantage of multiprocessor or multiple-core systems. Nonthreaded versions are also available and are faster for single-threaded applications. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available for some platforms. The 64-bit versions support larger heaps, while the 32-bit versions are faster for some applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em>'s interactive programming system includes an expression editor that, like many shells, supports command-line editing, a history mechanism, and command completion. Unlike most shells that support command-line editing, the expression editor properly supports multiline expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em> is intended to be as reliable and efficient as possible, with reliability taking precedence over efficiency if necessary. Reliability means behaving as designed and documented. While a <em>Chez Scheme</em> program can always fail to work properly because of a bug in the program, it should never fail because of a bug in the <em>Chez Scheme</em> implementation. Efficiency means performing at a high level, consuming minimal CPU time and memory. Performance should be balanced across features, across run time and compile time, and across programs and data of different sizes. These principles guide <em>Chez Scheme</em> language and tool design as well as choice of implementation technique; for example, a language feature or debugging hook might not exist in <em>Chez Scheme</em> because its presence would reduce reliability, efficiency, or both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The compiler has been rewritten for Version 9 and generates substantially faster code than the earlier compiler at the cost of greater compile time. This is the primary difference between Versions 8 and 9.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book (CSUG) is a companion to <a href="../../the-scheme-programming-language-4th/en/index.html">The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition</a> (TSPL4). TSPL4 serves as an introduction to and reference for R6RS, while CSUG describes <em>Chez Scheme</em> features and tools that are not part of R6RS. For the reader&#8217;s convenience, the summary of forms and index at the back of this book contain entries from both books, with each entry from TSPL4 marked with a "t" in front of its page number. In the online version, the page numbers given in the summary of forms and index double as direct links into one of the documents or the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional documentation for <em>Chez Scheme</em> includes release notes, a manual page, and a number of published papers and articles that describe various aspects of the system&#8217;s design and implementation.</p>

<p>This book describes <em>Chez Scheme</em> extensions to the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on Scheme <a href="#ref28">[28]</a> (R6RS). It contains as well a concise summary of standard and <em>Chez Scheme</em> forms and procedures, which gives the syntax of each form and the number and types of arguments accepted by each procedure. Details on standard R6RS features can be found in <a href="../../the-scheme-programming-language-4th/en/index.html">The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition</a> (TSPL4) <a href="#ref11">[11]</a> or the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on Scheme. <a href="../../the-scheme-programming-language-4th/en/index.html">The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition</a> also contains an extensive introduction to the Scheme language and numerous short and extended examples.</p>

<p>Most of this document also applies equally to <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em>, which is fully compatible with the complete <em>Chez Scheme</em> system but uses a high-speed interpreter in place of <em>Chez Scheme</em>'s incremental native-code compiler. Programs written for <em>Chez Scheme</em> run unchanged in <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> as long as they do not require the compiler to be invoked. In fact, <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> is built from the same sources as <em>Chez Scheme</em>, with all but the compiler sources included. A detailed discussion of the impact of this distinction appears in <a href="#section_2.8.">Section 2.8</a>.</p>

<p><em>Acknowledgments:</em> Michael Adams, Mike Ashley, Carl Bruggeman, Bob Burger, Sam Daniel, George Davidson, Matthew Flatt, Aziz Ghuloum, Bob Hieb, Andy Keep, and Oscar Waddell have contributed substantially to the development of <em>Chez Scheme</em>. <em>Chez Scheme</em>'s expression editor is based on a command-line editor for Scheme developed from 1989 through 1994 by C. David Boyer. File compression is performed with the use of the lz4 compression library developed by Yann Collet or the zlib compression library developed by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler. Implementations of the list and vector sorting routines are based on Olin Shiver&#8217;s opportunistic merge-sort algorithm and implementation. Michael Lenaghan provided a number of corrections for earlier drafts of this book. Many of the features documented in this book were suggested by current <em>Chez Scheme</em> users, and numerous comments from users have also led to improvements in the text. Additional suggestions for improvements to <em>Chez Scheme</em> and to this book are welcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="section_1.1.">Section 1.1. Chez Scheme Syntax</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em> extends Scheme&#8217;s syntax both at the object (datum) level and at the level of syntactic forms. At the object level, <em>Chez Scheme</em> supports additional representations for symbols that contain nonstandard characters, nondecimal numbers expressed in floating-point and scientific notation, vectors with explicit lengths, shared and cyclic structures, records, boxes, and more. These extensions are described below. Form-level extensions are described throughout the book and summarized in the Summary of Forms, which also appears in the back of this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em> extends the syntax of identifiers in several ways. First, the sequence of characters making up an identifier&#8217;s name may start with digits, periods, plus signs, and minus signs as long as the sequence cannot be parsed as a number. For example, <code>0abc</code>, <code>+++</code>, and <code>..</code> are all valid identifiers in <em>Chez Scheme</em>. Second, the single-character sequences <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are identifiers. Third, identifiers containing arbitrary characters may be printed by escaping them with <code>\</code> or with <code>|</code>. <code>\</code> is used to escape a single character (except 'x', since <code>\x</code> marks the start of a hex scalar value), whereas <code>|</code> is used to escape the group of characters that follow it up through the matching <code>|</code>. For example, <code>\||\|</code> is an identifier with a two-character name consisting of the character <code>|</code> followed by the character <code>\</code>, and <code>|hit me!|</code> is an identifier whose name contains a space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, gensyms (page <a href="#section_7.9.">7.9</a>) are printed with <code>#{</code> and <code>}</code> brackets that enclose both the "pretty" and "unique" names, e.g., <code>#{g1426 e5g1c94g642dssw-a}</code>. They may also be printed using the pretty name only with the prefix <code>#:</code>, e.g., <code>#:g1426</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Arbitrary radixes from two through 36 may be specified with the prefix <code>#<em>n</em>r</code>, where <code><em>n</em></code> is the radix. Case is not significant, so <code>#<em>n</em>R</code> may be used as well. Digit values from 10 through 35 are specified as either lower- or upper-case alphabetic characters, just as for hexadecimal numbers. For example, <code>#36rZZ</code> is \(35 × 36 + 35\), or 1295.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em> also permits nondecimal numbers to be printed in floating-point or scientific notation. For example, <code>#o1.4</code> is equivalent to <code>1.5</code>, and <code>#b1e10</code> is equivalent to <code>4.0</code>. Digits take precedence over exponent specifiers, so that <code>#x1e20</code> is simply the four-digit hexadecimal number equivalent to <code>7712</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the standard named characters <code>#\alarm</code>, <code>#\backspace</code>, <code>#\delete</code>, <code>#\esc</code>, <code>#\linefeed</code>, <code>#\newline</code>, <code>#\page</code>, <code>#\return</code>, <code>#\space</code>, and <code>#\tab</code>, <em>Chez Scheme</em> recognizes <code>#\bel</code>, <code>#\ls</code>, <code>#\nel</code>, <code>#\nul</code>, <code>#\rubout</code>, and <code>#\vt</code> (or <code>#\vtab</code>). Characters whose scalar values are less than 256 may also be printed with an octal syntax consisting of the prefix <code>#\</code> followed by a three octal-digit sequence. For example, <code>#\000</code> is equivalent to <code>#\nul</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em>'s fxvectors, or fixnum vectors, are printed like vectors but with the prefix <code>#vfx(</code> in place of <code>#(</code>. Vectors, bytevectors, and fxvectors may be printed with an explicit length prefix, and when the explicit length prefix is specified, duplicate trailing elements may be omitted. For example, <code>\#(a b c)</code> may be printed as <code>#3(a b c)</code>, and a vector of length 100 containing all zeros may be printed as <code>#100(0)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em>'s boxes are printed with a <code>#&amp;</code> prefix, e.g., <code>#&amp;17</code> is a box containing the integer <code>17</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Records are printed with the syntax <code>#[<em>type-name</em> <em>field</em> ...]</code>, where the symbol <code><em>type-name</em></code> is the name of the record type and <code><em>field</em> ...</code> are the printed representations for the contents of the fields of the record.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shared and cyclic structure may be printed using the graph mark and reference prefixes <code>#<em>n</em>=</code> and <code>#<em>n</em>#</code>. <code>#<em>n</em>=</code> is used to mark an item in the input, and <code>#<em>n</em>#</code> is used to refer to the item marked <code><em>n</em></code>. For example, <code>'(#1=(a) . #1#)</code> is a pair whose car and cdr contain the same list, and <code>#0=(a . #0#)</code> is a cyclic list, i.e., its cdr is itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code>$primitive</code> form (see <a href="#desc:hash-primitive">page 358</a>) may be abbreviated in the same manner as a <code>quote</code> form, using the <code>#%</code> prefix. For example, <code>#%car</code> is equivalent to <code>($primitive car)</code>, <code>#2%car</code> to <code>($primitive 2 car)</code>, and <code>#3%car</code> to <code>($primitive 3 car)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em>'s end-of-file object is printed <code>#!eof</code>. If the end-of-file object appears outside of any datum within a file being loaded, <code>load</code> will treat it as if it were a true end of file and stop loading at that point. Inserting <code>#!eof</code> into the middle of a file can thus be handy when tracking down a load-time error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Broken pointers in weak pairs (see <a href="#desc:weak-cons">page 406</a>) are represented by the <em>broken weak pointer</em> object, which is printed <code>#!bwp</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the standard delimiters (whitespace, open and close parentheses, open and close brackets, double quotes, semi-colon, and <code>#</code>), <em>Chez Scheme</em> also treats as delimiters open and close braces, single quote, backward quote, and comma.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Chez Scheme</em> lexical extensions described above are disabled in an input stream after an <code>#!r6rs</code> comment directive has been seen, unless a <code>#!chezscheme</code> comment directive has been seen since. Each library loaded implicitly via <code>import</code> and each RNRS top-level program loaded via the <code>--program</code> command-line option, the <code>scheme-script</code> command, or the <code>load-program</code> procedure is treated as if it begins implicitly with an <code>#!r6rs</code> comment directive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The case of symbol and character names is normally significant, as required by the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report. Names are folded, as if by <code>string-foldcase</code>, following a <code>#!fold-case</code> comment directive in the same input stream unless a <code>#!no-fold-case</code> has been seen since. Names are also folded if neither directive has been seen and the parameter <code>case-sensitive</code> has been set to <code>#f</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The printer invoked by <code>write</code>, <code>put-datum</code>, <code>pretty-print</code>, and the <code>format</code> <code>~s</code> option always prints standard Revised<sup>6</sup> Report objects using the standard syntax, unless a different behavior is requested via the setting of one of the print parameters. For example, it prints symbols in the extended identifier syntax of Chez Scheme described above using hex scalar value escapes, unless the parameter <code>print-extended-identifiers</code> is set to true. Similarly, it does not print the explicit length or suppress duplicate trailing elements unless the parameter <code>print-vector-length</code> is set to true.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="section_1.2.">Section 1.2. Notational Conventions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book follows essentially the same notational conventions as <a href="../../the-scheme-programming-language-4th/en/index.html">The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition</a>. These conventions are repeated below, with notes specific to <em>Chez Scheme</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the value produced by a procedure or syntactic form is said to be <em>unspecified</em>, the form or procedure may return any number of values, each of which may be any Scheme object. <em>Chez Scheme</em> usually returns a single, unique <em>void</em> object (see <code>void</code>) whenever the result is unspecified; avoid counting on this behavior, however, especially if your program may be ported to another Scheme implementation. Printing of the void object is suppressed by <em>Chez Scheme</em>'s waiter (read-evaluate-print loop).</p>
</div>
<div id="intro:s33" class="paragraph">
<p>This book uses the words "must" and "should" to describe program requirements, such as the requirement to provide an index that is less than the length of the vector in a call to <code>vector-ref</code>. If the word "must" is used, it means that the requirement is enforced by the implementation, i.e., an exception is raised, usually with condition type <code>&amp;assertion</code>. If the word "should" is used, an exception may or may not be raised, and if not, the behavior of the program is undefined. The phrase "syntax violation" is used to describe a situation in which a program is malformed. Syntax violations are detected prior to program execution. When a syntax violation is detected, an exception of type <code>&amp;syntax</code> is raised and the program is not executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scheme objects are displayed in a <code>typewriter</code> typeface just as they are to be typed at the keyboard. This includes identifiers, constant objects, parenthesized Scheme expressions, and whole programs. An <em>italic</em> typeface is used to set off syntax variables in the descriptions of syntactic forms and arguments in the descriptions of procedures. Italics are also used to set off technical terms the first time they appear. The first letter of an identifier that is not ordinarily capitalized is not capitalized when it appears at the beginning of a sentence. The same is true for syntax variables written in italics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the description of a syntactic form or procedure, a pattern shows the syntactic form or the application of the procedure. The syntax keyword or procedure name is given in typewriter font, as are parentheses. The remaining pieces of the syntax or arguments are shown in italics, using names that imply the types of the expressions or arguments expected by the syntactic form or procedure. Ellipses are used to specify zero or more occurrences of a subexpression or argument.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="section_1.3.">Section 1.3. Parameters</h3>
<div id="intro:s35" class="paragraph">
<p>All <em>Chez Scheme</em> system customization is done via <em>parameters</em>. A parameter is a procedure that encapsulates a hidden state variable. When invoked without arguments, a parameter returns the value of the encapsulated variable. When invoked with one argument, the parameter changes the value of the variable to the value of its argument. A parameter may raise an exception if its argument is not appropriate, or it may filter the argument in some way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New parameters may be created and used by programs running in <em>Chez Scheme</em>. Parameters are used rather than global variables for program customization for two reasons: First, unintentional redefinition of a customization variable can cause unexpected problems, whereas unintentional redefinition of a parameter simply makes the parameter inaccessible. For example, a program that defines <code>*print-level*</code> for its own purposes in early releases of <em>Chez Scheme</em> would have unexpected effects on the printing of Scheme objects, whereas a program that defines <code>print-level</code> for its own purposes simply loses the ability to alter the printer&#8217;s behavior. Of course, a program that invokes <code>print-level</code> by accident can still affect the system in unintended ways, but such an occurrence is less likely, and can only happen in an incorrect program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, invalid values for parameters can be detected and rejected immediately when the "assignment" is made, rather than at the point where the first use occurs, when it is too late to recover and reinstate the old value. For example, an assignment of <code>*print-level*</code> to -1 would not have been caught until the first call to <code>write</code> or <code>pretty-print</code>, whereas an attempted assignment of -1 to the parameter <code>print-level</code>, i.e., <code>(print-level -1)</code>, is flagged as an error immediately, before the change is actually made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Built-in system parameters are described in different sections throughout this book and are listed along with other syntactic forms and procedures in the Summary of Forms in the back of this book. Parameters marked "thread parameters" have per-thread values in threaded versions of <em>Chez Scheme</em>, while the values of parameters marked "global parameters" are shared by all threads. Nonthreaded versions of <em>Chez Scheme</em> do not distinguish between thread and global parameters. See Sections <a href="#section_12.13.">12.13</a> and <a href="#section_15.7.">15.7</a> for more information on creating and manipulating parameters.</p>

<h2 id="chp_2">Chapter 2. Using Chez Scheme</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em> is often used interactively to support program development and debugging, yet it may also be used to create stand-alone applications with no interactive component. This chapter describes the various ways in which <em>Chez Scheme</em> is typically used and, more generally, how to get the most out of the system. Sections <a href="#section_2.1.">2.1</a>, <a href="#section_2.2.">2.2</a>, and <a href="#section_2.3.">2.3</a> describe how one uses <em>Chez Scheme</em> interactively. <a href="#section_2.4.">Section 2.4</a> discusses how libraries and RNRS top-level programs are used in <em>Chez Scheme</em>. <a href="#section_2.5.">Section 2.5</a> covers support for writing and running Scheme scripts, including compiled scripts and compiled RNRS top-level programs. <a href="#section_2.6.">Section 2.6</a> describes how to structure and compile an application to get the most efficient code possible out of the compiler. <a href="#section_2.7.">Section 2.7</a> describes how one can customize the startup process, e.g., to alter or eliminate the command-line options, to preload Scheme or foreign code, or to run <em>Chez Scheme</em> as a subordinate program of another program. <a href="#section_2.8.">Section 2.8</a> describes how to build applications using <em>Chez Scheme</em> with <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> for run-time support. Finally, <a href="#section_2.9.">Section 2.9</a> covers command-line options used when invoking <em>Chez Scheme</em>.</p>

<h3 id="section_2.1.">Section 2.1. Interacting with Chez Scheme</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the simplest and most effective ways to write and test Scheme programs is to compose them using a text editor, like <code>vi</code> or <code>emacs</code>, and test them interactively with <em>Chez Scheme</em> running in a shell window. When <em>Chez Scheme</em> is installed with default options, entering the command <code>scheme</code> at the shell&#8217;s prompt starts an interactive Scheme session. The command <code>petite</code> does the same for <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em>. After entering this command, you should see a short greeting followed by an angle-bracket on a line by itself, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">Chez Scheme Version 9.5.1

></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also should see that the cursor is sitting one space to the right of the angle-bracket. The angle-bracket is a prompt issued by the system&#8217;s "REPL," which stands for "Read Eval Print Loop," so called because it reads, evaluates, and prints an expression, then loops back to read, evaluate, and print the next, and so on. (In <em>Chez Scheme</em>, the REPL is also called a waiter.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In response to the prompt, you can type any Scheme expression. If the expression is well-formed, the REPL will run the expression and print the value. Here are a few examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> 3
3
> (+ 3 4)
7
> (cons 'a '(b c d))
(a b c d)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reader used by the REPL is more sophisticated than an ordinary reader. In fact, it&#8217;s a full-blown "expression editor" ("expeditor" for short) like a regular text editor but for just one expression at a time. One thing you might soon notice is that the system automatically indents the second and subsequent lines of an expression. For example, let&#8217;s say we want to define <code>fact</code>, a procedure that implements the factorial function. If we type <code>(define fact</code> followed by the enter key, the cursor should be sitting under the first <code>e</code> in <code>define</code>, so that if we then type <code>(lambda (x)</code>, we should see:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (define fact
    (lambda (x)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expeditor also allows us to move around within the expression (even across lines) and edit the expression to correct mistakes. After typing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (define fact
    (lambda (x)
      (if (= n 0)
          0
          (* n (fact</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>we might notice that the procedure&#8217;s argument is named <code>x</code> but we have been referencing it as <code>n</code>. We can move back to the second line using the arrow keys, remove the offending <code>x</code> with the backspace key, and replace it with <code>n</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (define fact
    (lambda (n)
      (if (= n 0)
          0
          (* n (fact</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can then return to the end of the expression with the arrow keys and complete the definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (define fact
    (lambda (n)
      (if (= n 0)
          0
          (* n (fact (- n 1))))))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have a complete form with balanced parentheses, if we hit enter with the cursor just after the final parenthesis, the expeditor will send it on to the evaluator. We&#8217;ll know that it has accepted the definition when we get another right-angle prompt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can test our definition by entering, say, <code>(fact 6)</code> in response to the prompt:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (fact 6)
0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The printed value isn&#8217;t what we&#8217;d hoped for, since \(6!\) is actually 720. The problem, of course, is that the base-case return-value <code>0</code> should have been <code>1</code>. Fortunately, we don&#8217;t have to retype the definition to correct the mistake. Instead, we can use the expeditor&#8217;s history mechanism to retrieve the earlier definition. The up-arrow key moves backward through the history. In this case, the first up-arrow retrieves <code>(fact 6)</code>, and the second retrieves the <code>fact</code> definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we move back through the history, the expression editor shows us only the first line, so after two up arrows, this is all we see of the definition:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (define fact</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can force the expeditor to show the entire expression by typing <code>^L</code> (control <code>L</code>, i.e., the control and <code>L</code> keys pressed together):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (define fact
    (lambda (n)
      (if (= n 0)
          0
          (* n (fact (- n 1))))))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can move to the fourth line and change the <code>0</code> to a <code>1</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (define fact
    (lambda (n)
      (if (= n 0)
          1
          (* n (fact (- n 1))))))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;re now ready to enter the corrected definition. If the cursor is on the fourth line and we hit enter, however, it will just open up a new line between the old fourth and fifth lines. This is useful in other circumstances, but not now. Of course, we can work around this by using the arrow keys to move to the end of the expression, but an easier way is to type <code>^J</code>, which forces the expression to be entered immediately no matter where the cursor is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we can bring back <code>(fact 6)</code> with another two hits of the up-arrow key and try it again:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> (fact 6)
720</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To exit from the REPL and return back to the shell, we can type <code>^D</code> or call the <code>exit</code> procedure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interaction described above uses just a few of the expeditor&#8217;s features. The expeditor&#8217;s remaining features are described in the following section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Running programs may be interrupted by typing the interrupt character (typically <code>^C</code>). In response, the system enters a debug handler, which prompts for input with a <code>break&gt;</code> prompt. One of several commands may be issued to the break handler (followed by a newline), including</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">"e"</dt>
<dd>
<p>or end-of-file to exit from the handler and continue,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"r"</dt>
<dd>
<p>to stop execution and reset to the current café,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"a"</dt>
<dd>
<p>to abort <em>Chez Scheme</em>,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"n"</dt>
<dd>
<p>to enter a new café (see below),</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"i"</dt>
<dd>
<p>to inspect the current continuation,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"s"</dt>
<dd>
<p>to display statistics about the interrupted program, and</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"?"</dt>
<dd>
<p>to display a list of these options.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an exception other than a warning occurs, the default exception handler prints a message that describes the exception to the console error port. If a REPL is running, the exception handler then returns to the REPL, where the programmer can call the <code>debug</code> procedure to start up the debug handler, if desired. The debug handler is similar to the break handler and allows the programmer to inspect the continuation (control stack) of the exception to help determine the cause of the problem. If no REPL is running, as is the case for a script or top-level program run via the <code>--script</code> or <code>--program</code> command-line options, the default exception handler exits from the script or program after printing the message. To allow scripts and top-level programs to be debugged, the default exception handler can be forced via the <code>debug-on-exception</code> parameter or the <code>--debug-on-exception</code> command-line option to invoke <code>debug</code> directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Developing a large program entirely in the REPL is unmanageable, and we usually even want to store smaller programs in a file for future use. (The expeditor&#8217;s history is saved across Scheme sessions, but there is a limit on the number of items, so it is not a good idea to count on a program remaining in the history indefinitely.) Thus, a Scheme programmer typically creates a file containing Scheme source code using a text editor, such as <code>vi</code>, and loads the file into <em>Chez Scheme</em> to test them. The conventional filename extension for <em>Chez Scheme</em> source files is <code>.ss</code>, but the file can have any extension or even no extension at all. A source file can be loaded during an interactive session by typing <code>(load "<em>path</em>")</code>. Files to be loaded can also be named on the command line when the system is started. Any form that can be typed interactively can be placed in a file to be loaded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Chez Scheme</em> compiles source forms as it sees them to machine code before evaluating them, i.e., "just in time." In order to speed loading of a large file or group of files, each file can be compiled ahead of time via <code>compile-file</code>, which puts the compiled code into a separate object file. For example, <code>(compile-file "<em>path</em>")</code> compiles the forms in the file <code><em>path</em></code>.ss and places the resulting object code in the file <code><em>path</em></code>.so. Loading a pre-compiled file is essentially no different from loading the source file, except that loading is faster since compilation has already been done.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s6" class="paragraph">
<p>When compiling a file or set of files, it is often more convenient to use a shell command than to enter <em>Chez Scheme</em> interactively to perform the compilation. This is easily accomplished by "piping" in the command to compile the file as shown below.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="bash" class="language-bash hljs">echo '(compile-file "<em>filename</em>")' | scheme -q</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>-q</code> option suppresses the system&#8217;s greeting messages for more compact output, which is especially useful when compiling numerous files. The single-quote marks surrounding the <code>compile-file</code> call should be left off for Windows shells.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When running in this "batch" mode, especially from within "make" files, it is often desirable to force the default exception handler to exit immediately to the shell with a nonzero exit status. This may be accomplished by setting the <code>reset-handler</code> to <code>abort</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="bash" class="language-bash hljs">echo '(reset-handler abort) (compile-file "<em>filename</em>")' | scheme -q</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One can also redefine the <code>base-exception-handler</code> (<a href="#section_12.1.">Section 12.1</a>) to achieve a similar effect while exercising more control over the format of the messages that are produced.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="section_2.2.">Section 2.2. Expression Editor</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Chez Scheme is used interactively in a shell window, as described above, or when <code>new-cafe</code> is invoked explicitly from a top-level program or script run via <code>--program</code> or <code>--script</code>, the waiter&#8217;s "prompt and read" procedure employs an expression editor that permits entry and editing of single- and multiple-line expressions, automatically indents expressions as they are entered, supports identifier completion outside string constants based on the identifiers defined in the interactive environment, and supports filename completion within string constants. The expression editor also maintains a history of expressions typed during and across sessions and supports tcsh-like history movement and search commands. Other editing commands include simple cursor movement via arrow keys, deletion of characters via backspace and delete, and movement, deletion, and other commands using mostly emacs key bindings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expression editor does not run if the TERM environment variable is not set (on Unix-based systems), if the standard input or output files have been redirected, or if the <code>--eedisable</code> command-line option (<a href="#section_2.9.">Section 2.9</a>) has been used. The history is saved across sessions, by default, in the file ".chezscheme_history" in the user&#8217;s home directory. The <code>--eehistory</code> command-line option (<a href="#section_2.9.">Section 2.9</a>) can be used to specify a different location for the history file or to disable the saving and restoring of the history file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keys for nearly all printing characters (letters, digits, and special characters) are "self inserting" by default. The open parenthesis, close parenthesis, open bracket, and close bracket keys are self inserting as well, but also cause the editor to "flash" to the matching delimiter, if any. Furthermore, when a close parenthesis or close bracket is typed, it is automatically corrected to match the corresponding open delimiter, if any.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Key bindings for other keys and key sequences initially recognized by the expression editor are given below, organized into groups by function. Some keys or key sequences serve more than one purpose depending upon context. For example, tab is used for identifier completion, filename completion, and indentation. Such bindings are shown in each applicable functional group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple-key sequences are displayed with hyphens between the keys of the sequences, but these hyphens should not be entered. When two or more key sequences perform the same operation, the sequences are shown separated by commas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Detailed descriptions of the editing commands are given in <a href="#chp_14">Chapter 14</a>, which also describes parameters that allow control over the expression editor, mechanisms for adding or changing key bindings, and mechanisms for creating new commands.</p>

<h3 id="section_2.3.">Section 2.3. The Interaction Environment</h3>
<div id="use:s11" class="paragraph">
<p>In the language of the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report, code is structured into libraries and "top-level programs." The Revised<sup>6</sup> Report does not require an implementation to support interactive use, and it does not specify how an interactive top level should operate, leaving such details up to the implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <em>Chez Scheme</em>, when one enters definitions or expressions at the prompt or loads them from a file, they operate on an interaction environment, which is a mutable environment that initially holds bindings only for built-in keywords and primitives. It may be augmented by user-defined identifier bindings via top-level definitions. The interaction environment is also referred to as the top-level environment, because it is at the top level for purposes of scoping. Programs entered at the prompt or loaded from a file via <code>load</code> should not be confused with RNRS top-level programs, which are actually more similar to libraries in their behavior. In particular, while the same identifier can be defined multiple times in the interaction environment, to support incremental program development, an identifier can be defined at most once in an RNRS top-level program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default interaction environment used for any code that occurs outside of an RNRS top-level program or library (including such code typed at a prompt or loaded from a file) contains all of the bindings of the <code>(chezscheme)</code> library (or <code>scheme</code> module, which exports the same set of bindings). This set contains a number of bindings that are not in the RNRS libraries. It also contains a number of bindings that extend the RNRS counterparts in some way and are thus not strictly compatible with the RNRS bindings for the same identifiers. To replace these with bindings strictly compatible with RNRS, simply import the <code>rnrs</code> libraries into the interaction environment by typing the following into the REPL or loading it from a file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(import
  (rnrs)
  (rnrs eval)
  (rnrs mutable-pairs)
  (rnrs mutable-strings)
  (rnrs r5rs))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="use:s12" class="paragraph">
<p>To obtain an interaction environment that contains all <em>and only</em> RNRS bindings, use the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(interaction-environment

      '(rnrs mutable-pairs)
      '(rnrs mutable-strings)
      '(rnrs r5rs))
    #t))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be useful for most purposes, <code>library</code> and <code>import</code> should probably also be included, from the <code>(chezscheme)</code> library.</p>

      '(only (chezscheme) library import))
    #t))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It might also be useful to include <code>debug</code> in the set of identifiers imported from <code>(chezscheme)</code> to allow the debugger to be entered after an exception is raised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the identifiers bound in the default interaction environment that are not strictly compatible with the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report are variables bound to procedures with extended interfaces, i.e., optional arguments or extended argument domains. The others are keywords bound to transformers that extend the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report syntax in some way. This should not be a problem except for programs that count on exceptions being raised in cases that coincide with the extensions. For example, if a program passes the <code>=</code> procedure a single numeric argument and expects an exception to be raised, it will fail in the initial interaction environment because <code>=</code> returns <code>#t</code> when passed a single numeric argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the default interaction environment and those created as described above, variables that name built-in procedures are read-only, i.e., cannot be assigned, since they resolve to the read-only bindings exported from the <code>(chezscheme)</code> library or some other library:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(set! cons +) ⇒ <em>exception: cons is immutable</em></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before assigning a variable bound to the name of a built-in procedure, the programmer must first define the variable. For example,</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(define cons-count 0)
(define original-cons cons)

    (original-cons x y)))</code></pre>

<p>turns <code>cons</code> into a mutable variable with the same value as it originally had. Doing so, however, prevents the compiler from generating efficient code for calls to <code>cons</code> or producing warning messages when <code>cons</code> is passed the wrong number of arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All identifiers not bound in the initial interaction environment and not defined by the programmer are treated as "potentially bound" as variables to facilitate the definition of mutually recursive procedures. For example, assuming that <code>yin</code> and <code>yang</code> have not been defined,</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(define yin (lambda () (- (yang) 1)))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>defines <code>yin</code> at top level as a variable bound to a procedure that calls the value of the top-level variable <code>yang</code>, even though <code>yang</code> has not yet been defined. If this is followed by</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(define yang (lambda () (+ (yin) 1)))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the result is a mutually recursive pair of procedures that, when called, will loop indefinitely or until the system runs out of space to hold the recursion stack. If <code>yang</code> must be defined as anything other than a variable, its definition should precede the definition of <code>yin</code>, since the compiler assumes <code>yang</code> is a variable in the absence of any indication to the contrary when <code>yang</code> has not yet been defined.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s13" class="paragraph">
<p>A subtle consequence of this useful quirk of the interaction environment is that the procedure <code>free-identifier=?</code> (<a href="../../the-scheme-programming-language-4th/en/index.html#section_8.3.">Section 8.3</a> of <em>The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition</em>) does not consider unbound library identifiers to be equivalent to (as yet) undefined top-level identifiers, even if they have the same name, because the latter are actually assumed to be valid variable bindings.</p>

</div>
<div id="use:s14" class="paragraph">
<p>If it is necessary that they have the same binding, as in the case where an identifier is used as an auxiliary keyword in a syntactic abstraction exported from a library and used at top level, the library should define and export a binding for the identifier.</p>

<h3 id="section_2.4.">Section 2.4. Using Libraries and Top-Level Programs</h3>
<div id="use:s16" class="paragraph">
<p>An R6RS library can be defined directly in the REPL, loaded explicitly from a file (using <code>load</code> or <code>load-library</code>), or loaded implicitly from a file via <code>import</code>. When defined directly in the REPL or loaded explicitly from a file, a library form can be used to redefine an existing library, but <code>import</code> never reloads a library once it has been defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A library to be loaded implicitly via <code>import</code> must reside in a file whose name reflects the name of the library. For example, if the library&#8217;s name is <code>(tools sorting)</code>, the base name of the file must be <code>sorting</code> with a valid extension, and the file must be in a directory named <code>tools</code> which itself resides in one of the directories searched by <code>import</code>. The set of directories searched by <code>import</code> is determined by the <code>library-directories</code> parameter, and the set of extensions is determined by the <code>library-extensions</code> parameter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The values of both parameters are lists of pairs of strings. The first string in each <code>library-directories</code> pair identifies a source-file base directory, and the second identifies the corresponding object-file base directory. Similarly, the first string in each <code>library-extensions</code> pair identifies a source-file extension, and the second identifies the corresponding object-file extension. The full path of a library source or object file consists of the source or object base followed by the components of the library name, separated by slashes, with the library extension added on the end. For example, for base <code>/usr/lib/scheme</code>, library name <code>(app lib1)</code>, and extension <code>.sls</code>, the full path is <code>/usr/lib/scheme/app/lib1.sls</code>. So, if <code>(library-directories)</code> contains the pathnames <code>"/usr/lib/scheme/libraries"</code> and <code>"."</code>, and <code>(library-extensions)</code> contains the extensions <code>.ss</code> and <code>.sls</code>, the path of the <code>(tools sorting)</code> library must be one of the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">/usr/lib/scheme/libraries/tools/sorting.ss
/usr/lib/scheme/libraries/tools/sorting.sls
./tools/sorting.ss
./tools/sorting.sls</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When searching for a library, <code>import</code> first constructs a partial name from the list of components in the library name, e.g., <code>a/b</code> for library <code>(a b)</code>. It then searches for the partial name in each pair of base directories, in order, trying each of the source extensions then each of the object extensions in turn before moving onto the next pair of base directories. If the partial name is an absolute pathname, e.g., <code>~/.myappinit</code> for a library named <code>(~/.myappinit)</code>, only the specified absolute path is searched, first with each source extension, then with each object extension. If the expander finds both a source file and its corresponding object file, and the object file is not older than the source file, the expander loads the object file. If the object file does not exist, if the object file is older, or if after loading the object file, the expander determines it was built using a library or include file that has changed, the source file is loaded or compiled, depending on the value of the parameter <code>compile-imported-libraries</code>. If <code>compile-imported-libraries</code> is set to <code>#t</code>, the expander compiles the library via the value of the <code>compile-library-handler</code> parameter, which by default calls <code>compile-library</code> (which is described below). Otherwise, the expander loads the source file. (Loading the source file actually causes the code to be compiled, assuming the default value of <code>current-eval</code>, but the compiled code is not saved to an object file.) An exception is raised during this process if a source or object file exists but is not readable or if an object file cannot be created.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s21" class="paragraph">
<p>The search process used by the expander when processing an <code>import</code> for a library that has not yet been loaded can be monitored by setting the parameter <code>import-notify</code> to <code>#t</code>. This parameter can be set from the command line via the <code>--import-notify</code> command-line option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever the expander determines it must compile a library to a file or load one from source, it adds the directory in which the file resides to the front of the <code>source-directories</code> list while compiling or loading the library. This allows a library to include files stored in or relative to its own directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <code>import</code> compiles a library as described above, it does not also load the compiled library, because this would cause portions of library to be reevaluated. Because of this, run-time expressions in the file outside of a <code>library</code> form will not be evaluated. If such expressions are present and should be evaluated, the library should be compiled ahead of time or loaded explicitly.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s24" class="paragraph">
<p>A file containing a library may be compiled with <code>compile-file</code> or <code>compile-library</code>. The only difference between the two is that the latter treats the source file as if it were prefixed by an implicit <code>#!r6rs</code>, which disables <em>Chez Scheme</em> lexical extensions unless an explicit <code>#!chezscheme</code> marker appears in the file. Any libraries upon which the library depends must be compiled first. If one of the libraries imported by the library is subsequently recompiled (say because it was modified), the importing library must also be recompiled. Compilation and recompilation of imported libraries must be done explicitly by default but is done automatically when the parameter <code>compile-imported-libraries</code> is set to <code>#t</code> before compiling the importing library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with <code>compile-file</code>, <code>compile-library</code> can be used in "batch" mode via a shell command:</p>

<p>A top-level program stored in a file can be loaded from the file via the <code>load-program</code> procedure. A top-level program can also be loaded via <code>load</code>, but not without affecting the semantics. A program loaded via <code>load</code> is scoped at top level, where it can see all top-level bindings, whereas a top-level program loaded via <code>load-program</code> is self-contained, i.e., it can see only the bindings made visible by the leading <code>import</code> form. Also, the variable bindings in a program loaded via <code>load</code> also become top-level bindings, whereas they are local to the program when the program is loaded via <code>load-program</code>. Moreover, <code>load-program</code>, like <code>load-library</code>, treats the source file as if it were prefixed by an implicit <code>#!r6rs</code>, which disables <em>Chez Scheme</em> lexical extensions unless an explicit <code>#!chezscheme</code> marker appears in the file. A program loaded via <code>load</code> is also likely to be less efficient. Since the program&#8217;s variables are not local to the program, the compiler must assume they could change at any time, which inhibits many of its optimizations.</p>

<p>Top-level programs may be compiled using <code>compile-program</code>, which is like <code>compile-file</code> but, as with <code>load-program</code>, properly implements the semantics and lexical restrictions of top-level programs. <code>compile-program</code> also copies the leading <code>#!</code> line, if any, from the source file to the object file, resulting in an executable object file. Any libraries upon which the top-level program depends, other than built-in libraries, must be compiled first. The program must be recompiled if any of the libraries upon which it depends are recompiled. Compilation and recompilation of imported libraries must be done explicitly by default but is done automatically when the parameter <code>compile-imported-libraries</code> is set to <code>#t</code> before compiling the importing library.</p>

<h3 id="section_2.6.">Section 2.6. Optimization</h3>
<div id="use:s41" class="paragraph">
<p>To get the most out of the <em>Chez Scheme</em> compiler, it is necessary to give it a little bit of help. The most important assistance is to avoid the use of top-level (interaction-environment) bindings. Top-level bindings are convenient and appropriate during program development, since they simplify testing, redefinition, and tracing (<a href="#section_3.1.">Section 3.1</a>) of individual procedures and syntactic forms. This convenience comes at a sizable price, however.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s43" class="paragraph">
<p>The compiler can propagate copies (of one variable to another or of a constant to a variable) and inline procedures bound to local, unassigned variables within a single top-level expression. For the procedures it does not inline, it can avoid constructing and passing unneeded closures, bypass argument-count checks, branch to the proper entry point in a case-lambda, and build rest arguments (more efficiently) on the caller side, where the length of the rest list is known at compile time. It can also discard the definitions of unreferenced variables, so there&#8217;s no penalty for including a large library of routines, only a few of which are actually used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It cannot do any of this with top-level variable bindings, since the top-level bindings can change at any time and new references to those bindings can be introduced at any time.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s45" class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, it is easy to restructure a program to avoid top-level bindings. This is naturally accomplished for portable code by placing the code into a single RNRS top-level program or by placing a portion of the code in a top-level program and the remainder in one or more separate libraries. Although not portable, one can also put all of the code into a single top-level <code>module</code> form or <code>let</code> expression, perhaps using <code>include</code> to bring in portions of the code from separate files. The compiler performs some optimization even across library boundaries, so the penalty for breaking a program up in this manner is generally acceptable. The compiler also supports whole-program optimization (via <code>compile-whole-program</code>), which can be used to eliminate all overhead for placing portions of a program into separate libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once an application&#8217;s code has been placed into a single top-level program or into a top-level program and one or more libraries, the code can be loaded from source via <code>load-program</code> or compiled via <code>compile-program</code> and <code>compile-library</code>, as described in <a href="#section_2.4.">Section 2.4</a>. Be sure not to use <code>compile-file</code> for the top-level program since this does not preserve the semantics nor result in code that is as efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With an application structured as a single top-level program or as a top-level program and one or more libraries that do not interact frequently, we have done most of what can be done to help the compiler, but there are still a few more things we can do.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s49" class="paragraph">
<p>First, we can allow the compiler to generate "unsafe" code, i.e., allow the compiler to generate code in which the usual run-time type checks have been disabled. We do this by using the compiler&#8217;s "optimize level 3" when compiling the program and library files. This can be accomplished by setting the parameter <code>optimize-level</code> to 3 while compiling the library or program, e.g.:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(parameterize ([optimize-level 3]) (compile-program "<em>filename</em>"))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="use:s50" class="paragraph">
<p>or in batch mode via the <code>--optimize-level</code> command-line option:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="bash" class="language-bash hljs">echo '(compile-program "<em>filename</em>")' | scheme -q --optimize-level 3</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may also be useful to experiment with some of the other compiler control parameters and also with the storage manager&#8217;s run-time operation. The compiler-control parameters, including <code>optimize-level</code>, are described in <a href="#section_12.6.">Section 12.6</a>, and the storage manager control parameters are described in <a href="#section_13.1.">Section 13.1</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s51" class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, it is often useful to "profile" your code to determine that parts of the code that are executed most frequently. While this will not help the system optimize your code, it can help you identify "hot spots" where you need to concentrate your own hand-optimization efforts. In these hot spots, consider using more efficient operators, like fixnum or flonum operators in place of generic arithmetic operators, and using explicit loops rather than nested combinations of linear list-processing operators like <code>append</code>, <code>reverse</code>, and <code>map</code>. These operators can make code more readable when used judiciously, but they can slow down time-critical code.</p>

<p><a href="#section_12.7.">Section 12.7</a> describes how to use the compiler&#8217;s support for automatic profiling.

<p><em>Chez Scheme</em> and <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> are built from several subsystems: a "kernel" encapsulated in a static or shared library (dynamic link library) that contains operating-system interface and low-level storage management code, an executable that parses command-line arguments and calls into the kernel to initialize and run the system, a base boot file (petite.boot) that contains the bulk of the run-time library code, and an additional boot file (scheme.boot), for <em>Chez Scheme</em> only, that contains the compiler.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the kernel and base boot file are essential to the operation of all programs, the executable may be replaced or even eliminated, and the compiler boot file need be loaded only if the compiler is actually used.

These entry points may be used to create your own executable image that has different (or no) command-line options or to run Scheme as a subordinate program within another program, i.e., for use as an extension language.</p>

<h3 id="section_2.8.">Section 2.8. Building and Distributing Applications</h3>
<div id="use:s58" class="paragraph">
<p>Although useful as a stand-alone Scheme system, <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> was conceived as a run-time system for compiled <em>Chez Scheme</em> applications. The remainder of this section describes how to create and distribute such applications using <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em>. It begins with a discussion of the characteristics of <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> and how it compares with <em>Chez Scheme</em>, then describes how to prepare application source code, how to build and run applications, and how to distribute them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Petite Chez Scheme Characteristics.  Although interpreter-based, <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> evaluates Scheme source code faster than might be expected. Some of the reasons for this are listed below.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The run-time system is fully compiled, so library implementations of primitives ranging from <code>+</code> and <code>car</code> to <code>sort</code> and <code>printf</code> are just as efficient as in <em>Chez Scheme</em>, although they cannot be open-coded as in code compiled by <em>Chez Scheme</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interpreter is itself a compiled Scheme application. Because it is written in Scheme, it directly benefits from various characteristics of Scheme that would have to be dealt with explicitly and with additional overhead in most other languages, including proper treatment of tail calls, first-class procedures, automatic storage management, and continuations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interpreter employs a preprocessor that converts the code into a form that can be interpreted efficiently. In fact, the preprocessor shares its front end with the compiler, and this front end performs a variety of source-level optimizations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, compiled code is still more efficient for most applications. The difference between the speed of interpreted and compiled code varies significantly from one application to another, but often amounts to a factor of five and sometimes to a factor of ten or more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several additional limitations result from the fact that <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> does not include the compiler:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The compiler must be present to process <code>foreign-procedure</code> and <code>foreign-callable</code> expressions, even when these forms are evaluated by the interpreter. These forms cannot be processed by the interpreter alone, so they cannot appear in source code to be processed by <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em>. Compiled versions of <code>foreign-procedure</code> and <code>foreign-callable</code> forms may, however, be included in compiled code loaded into <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspector information is attached to code objects, which are generated only by the compiler, so source information and variable names are not available for interpreted procedures or continuations into interpreted procedures. This makes the inspector less effective for debugging interpreted code than it is for debugging compiled code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedure names are also attached to code objects, so while the compiler associates a name with each procedure when an appropriate name can be determined, the interpreter does not do so. This mostly impacts the quality of error messages, e.g., an error message might read " incorrect number of arguments to <code>#&lt;procedure&gt;</code> " rather than the likely more useful " incorrect number of arguments to <code>#&lt;procedure <em>name</em>&gt;</code> ".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compiler detects, at compile time, some potential errors that the interpreter does not detect and reports them via compile-time warnings that identify the expression or the location in the source file, if any, where the expression appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic profiling cannot be enabled for interpreted code as it is for compiled code when <code>compile-profile</code> is set to <code>#t</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Except as noted above, <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> does not restrict what programs can do, and like <em>Chez Scheme</em>, it places essentially no limits on the size of programs or the memory images they create, beyond the inherent limitations of the underlying hardware or operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Compiled scripts and programs.</strong> One simple mechanism for distributing an application is to structure it as a script or RNRS top-level program, use <code>compile-script</code> or <code>compile-program</code>, as appropriate to compile it as described in <a href="#section_2.5.">Section 2.5</a>, and distribute the resulting object file along with a complete distribution of <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em>. When this mechanism is used on Unix-based systems, if the source file begins with <code>#!</code> and the path that follows is the path to the <em>Chez Scheme</em> executable, e.g., <code>/usr/bin/scheme</code>, the one at the front of the object file should be replaced with the path to the <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> executable, e.g., <code>/usr/bin/petite</code>. The path may have to be adjusted by the application&#8217;s installation program based on where <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> is installed on the target system. When used under Windows, the application&#8217;s installation program should set up an appropriate shortcut that starts <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> with the <code>--script</code> or <code>--program</code> option, as appropriate, followed by the path to the object file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The remainder of this section describes how to distribute applications that do not require <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> to be installed as a stand-alone system on the target machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Preparing Application Code.</strong> While it is possible to distribute applications in source-code form, i.e., as a set of Scheme source files to be loaded into <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> by the end user, distributing compiled code has two major advantages over distributing source code. First, compiled code is usually much more efficient, as discussed in the preceding section, and second, compiled code is in binary form and thus provides more protection for proprietary application code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Application source code generally consists of a set of Scheme source files possibly augmented by foreign code developed specifically for the application and packaged in shared libraries (also known as shared objects or, on Windows, dynamic link libraries). The following assumes that any shared-library source code has been converted into object form; how to do this varies by platform. (Some hints are given in <a href="#section_4.6.">Section 4.6</a>.) The result is a set of one or more shared libraries that are loaded explicitly by the Scheme source code during program initialization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the shared libraries have been created, the next step is to compile the Scheme source files into a set of Scheme object files. Doing so typically involves simply invoking <code>compile-file</code>, <code>compile-library</code>, or <code>compile-program</code>, as appropriate, on each source file to produce the corresponding object file. This may be done within a build script or "make" file via a command line such as the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="bash" class="language-bash hljs">echo '(compile-file "<em>filename</em>")' | scheme</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>which produces the object file <code>filename.so</code> from the source file <code>filename.ss</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the application code has been developed interactively or is usually loaded directly from source, it may be necessary to make some adjustments to a file to be compiled if the file contains expressions or definitions that affect the compilation of subsequent forms in the file. This can be accomplished via <code>eval-when</code> (<a href="#section_12.4.">Section 12.4</a>). This is not typically necessary or desirable if the application consists of a set of RNRS libraries and programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may also wish to disable generation of inspector information both to reduce the size of the compiled application code and to prevent others from having access to the expanded source code that is retained as part of the inspector information. To do so, set the parameter <code>generate-inspector-information</code> to <code>#f</code> while compiling each file The downside of disabling inspector information is that the information will not be present if you need to debug your application, so it is usually desirable to disable inspector information only for production builds of your application. An alternative is to compile the code with inspector information enabled and strip out the debugging information later with <code>strip-fasl-file</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scheme startup procedure determines what the system does when it is started. The default startup procedure loads the files listed on the command line (via <code>load</code>) and starts up a new café, like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(lambda fns (for-each load fns) (new-cafe))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The startup procedure may be changed via the parameter <code>scheme-start</code>. The following example demonstrates the installation of a variant of the default startup procedure that prints the name of each file before loading it.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(scheme-start

        (load fn)
        (printf "~%"))
      fns)
    (new-cafe)))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical application startup procedure would first invoke the application&#8217;s initialization procedure(s) and then start the application itself:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any shared libraries that must be present during the running of an application must be loaded during initialization. In addition, all foreign procedure expressions must be executed after the shared libraries are loaded so that the addresses of foreign routines are available to be recorded with the resulting foreign procedures. The following demonstrates one way in which initialization might be accomplished for an application that links to a foreign procedure <code>show_state</code> in the Windows shared library <code>state.dll</code>:</p>

<p><strong>Building and Running the Application.</strong> Building and running an application is straightforward once all shared libraries have been built and Scheme source files have been compiled to object code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although not strictly necessary, we suggest that you concatenate your object files, if you have more than one, into a single object file via the <code>concatenate-object-files</code> procedure. Placing all of the object code into a single file simplifies both building and distribution of applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For top-level programs with separate libraries, <code>compile-whole-program</code> can be used to produce a single, fully optimized object file. Otherwise, when concatenating object files, put each library after the libraries it depends upon, with the program last.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the Scheme object code contained within a single composite object file, it is possible to run the application simply by loading the composite object file into <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em>, e.g.:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="bash" class="language-bash hljs">petite app.so</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <code>app.so</code> is the name of the composite object file, and invoking the startup procedure to restart the system:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">> ((scheme-start))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point of setting <code>scheme-start</code>, however, is to allow the set of object files to be converted into a <em>boot file</em>. Boot files are loaded during the process of building the initial heap. Because of this, boot files have the following advantages over ordinary object files.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any code and data structures contained in the boot file or created while it is loaded is automatically compacted along with the base run-time library code and made static. Static code and data are never collected by the storage manager, so garbage collection overhead is reduced. (It is also possible to make code and data static explicitly at any time via the <code>collect</code> procedure.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system looks for boot files automatically in a set of standard directories based on the name of the executable image, so you can install a copy of the <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> executable image under your application&#8217;s name and spare your users from supplying any command-line arguments or running a separate script to load the application code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="use:s69" class="paragraph">
<p>When an application is packaged into a boot file, the source code that is compiled and converted into a boot file should set <code>scheme-start</code> to a procedure that starts the application, as shown in the example above. The application should not be started directly from the boot file, because boot files are loaded before final initialization of the Scheme system. The value of <code>scheme-start</code> is invoked automatically after final initialization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A boot file is simply an object file containing the code for one or more source files, prefixed by a boot header. The boot header identifies a base boot file upon which the application directly depends, or possibly two or more alternatives upon which the application can be run. In most cases, petite.boot will be identified as the base boot file, but in a layered application it may be another boot file of your creation that in turn depends upon petite.boot. The base boot file, and its base boot file, if any, are loaded automatically when your application boot file is loaded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Boot files are created with <code>make-boot-file</code>. This procedure accepts two or more arguments. The first is a string naming the file into which the boot header and object code should be placed, the second is a list of strings naming base boot files, and the remainder are strings naming input files. For example, the call:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(make-boot-file "app.boot" '("petite") "app1.so" "app2.ss" "app3.so")</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>creates the boot file app.boot that identifies a dependency upon petite.boot and contains the object code for app1.so, the object code resulting from compiling app2.ss, and the object code for app3.so. The call:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="scheme" class="language-scheme hljs">(make-boot-file "app.boot" '("scheme" "petite") "app.so")</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>creates a header file that identifies a dependency upon either scheme.boot or petite.boot, with the object code from app.so. In the former case, the system will automatically load petite.boot when the application boot file is loaded, and in the latter it will load scheme.boot if it can find it, otherwise petite.boot. This would allow your application to run on top of the full <em>Chez Scheme</em> if present, otherwise <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, you can construct your application so it does not depend upon features of scheme.boot (specifically, the compiler) by specifying only <code>"petite"</code> in the call to <code>make-boot-file</code>. If your application calls <code>eval</code>, however, and you wish to allow users to be able to take advantage of the faster execution speed of compiled code, then specifying both <code>"scheme"</code> and <code>"petite"</code> is appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is how we might create and run a simple "echo" application from a Linux shell:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="bash" class="language-bash hljs">echo '(suppress-greeting #t)' > myecho.ss
echo '(scheme-start (lambda fns (printf "~{~a~^ ~}\n" fns)))' >> myecho.ss
echo '(compile-file "myecho.ss") \
      (make-boot-file "myecho.boot" (quote ("petite")) "myecho.so")' \
     | scheme -q
scheme -b myecho.boot hello world</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we take the extra step of installing a copy of the <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> executable as <code>myecho</code> and copying <code>myecho.boot</code> into the same directory as <code>petite.boot</code> (or set SCHEMEHEAPDIRS to include the directory containing myecho.boot), we can simply invoke <code>myecho</code> to run our echo application:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="bash" class="language-bash hljs">myecho hello world</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Distributing the Application.</strong> Distributing an application involves can be as simple as creating a distribution package that includes the following items:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> distribution,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the application boot file,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any application-specific shared libraries,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an application installation script.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application installation script should install <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> if not already installed on the target system. It should install the application boot file in the same directory as the <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> boot file petite.boot is installed, and it should install the application shared libraries, if any, either in the same location or in a standard location for shared libraries on the target system. It should also create a link to or copy of the <em>Petite Chez Scheme</em> executable under the name of your application, i.e., the name given to your application boot file. Where appropriate, it should also install desktop and start-menu shortcuts to run the executable.</p>

<p>With the default <code>scheme-start</code> procedure (<a href="#section_2.8.">Section 2.8</a>), any remaining command-line arguments are treated as the names of files to be loaded before <em>Chez Scheme</em> begins interacting with the user, unless the <code>--script</code> or <code>--program</code> is present, in which case the remaining arguments are made available to the script via the <code>command-line</code> parameter (<a href="#section_2.1.">Section 2.1</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the options are described elsewhere in this chapter, and a few are self-explanatory. The remainder pertain to the loading of boot files at system start-up time and are described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="use:s99" class="paragraph">
<p>When <em>Chez Scheme</em> is run, it looks for one or more boot files to load. Boot files contain the compiled Scheme code that implements most of the Scheme system, including the interpreter, compiler, and most libraries. Boot files may be specified explicitly on the command line via <code>-b</code> options or implicitly. In the simplest case, no <code>-b</code> options are given and the necessary boot files are loaded automatically based on the name of the executable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if the executable name is "frob", the system looks for "frob.boot" in a set of standard directories. It also looks for and loads any subordinate boot files required by "frob.boot".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subordinate boot files are also loaded automatically for the first boot file explicitly specified via the command line. Each boot file must be listed before those that depend upon it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>--verbose</code> option may be used to trace the file searching process and must appear before any boot arguments for which search tracing is desired.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ordinarily, the search for boot files is limited to a set of installation directories, but this may be overridden by setting the environment variable <code>SCHEMEHEAPDIRS</code>. <code>SCHEMEHEAPDIRS</code> should be a colon-separated list of directories, listed in the order in which they should be searched. Within each directory, the two-character escape sequence <code>%v</code> is replaced by the current version, and the two-character escape sequence <code>%m</code> is replaced by the machine type. A percent followed by any other character is replaced by the second character; in particular, <code>%%</code> is replaced by <code>%</code>, and <code>%:</code> is replaced by <code>:</code>. If <code>SCHEMEHEAPDIRS</code> ends in a non-escaped colon, the default directories are searched after those in <code>SCHEMEHEAPDIRS</code>; otherwise, only those listed in <code>SCHEMEHEAPDIRS</code> are searched.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under Windows, semi-colons are used in place of colons, and one additional escape is recognized: <code>%x</code>, which is replaced by the directory in which the executable file resides. The default search path under Windows consists of <code>%x</code> and <code>%x\..\..\boot\%m</code>. The registry key <code>HeapSearchPath</code> in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Chez Scheme\csv<em>version</em></code>, where <code><em>version</em></code> is the <em>Chez Scheme</em> version number, e.g., <code>7.9.4</code>, can be set to override the default search path, and the <code>SCHEMEHEAPDIRS</code> environment variable overrides both the default and the registry setting, if any.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Boot files consist of ordinary compiled code and consist of a boot header and the compiled code for one or more source files. See <a href="#section_2.8.">Section 2.8</a> for instructions on how to create boot files.</p>
